This is a simple Jekyll theme for your static blog. Here you can find anything you need to test the theme, package a gem containing the theme and test that gem in a sample Jekyll site; you can find an example in the `test-gem` folder. The published gem is [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/forest-time-jekyll/versions/0.1.0.pre.beta).

To get started just run `bundle`, then `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
