On this very day I've launched my blog. As it was a milestone I've kept this post. Since then, the blog has gone through several changes both in content and context. In the beginning I've used WordPress and the content was pretty unclear. It took a long way to figure out what is it that I actually want it to be.

> Hi mate, my name is Gabor, and this is my blog. In fact, it will be. Since I have some projects to get done, my time is very limited, but sooner or later my thoughts about the world will be found to read here! So stay tuned, and subscribe if you don't want to miss the big launch! Wishing you the best: Gabor
