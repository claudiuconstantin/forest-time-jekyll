Learning new skills either via books, tutorials, videos or from school is always nice, but my personal experience is that the most beneficial way of learning happens when the need is present. Making small projects which entertain you only by making them.

So just to make the #100DaysOfCode challenge a bit more fun I have came out with a small project idea which is going to be a very simple arcade game, called the Hydra.

After reading a lot about "Should I learn JS first, or jump right into jQuery" I decided to start with pure JavaScript before I master the wonderful power of jQuery.

Being a good designer, I couldn't resist to start working the on the graphics *(an image has been removed from here)*.

~~Here is the code from the first day, and of course you can follow the development process in the 100DaysOfCode folder.~~
