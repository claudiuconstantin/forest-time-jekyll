With a friend of mine I have decided to create a MEAN application just for fun. To make it interesting we are going to build it with **Angular 2**. Here are the list of tutorials I have went through so far:

  1. Read about how to set up Heroku: [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction)
  2. Nodejs basics: [Node Hero - Node.js Project Structure Tutorial](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-node-js-project-structure-tutorial/)
  3. Mean stack with DBaS: [Create a Web App and RESTful API Server Using the MEAN Stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mean-apps-restful-api)

  4. Get started with Angular 2: [Angular Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html#!#create-and-configure)
