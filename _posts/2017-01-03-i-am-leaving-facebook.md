Today it has been 2 weeks since I have requested my account deletion on one of the world's biggest social media, so that's it. I have quit Facebook.

ARTICLE

 - The feed and showing off
 - Communicating - you can reach anyone, Facebook groups, you will get behind. No need.

 Two main reasons to stay:
 Facebook Groups (link to app)
 Messenger

 Not good or bad, not that black and white. What it is worth to consider is the cost - returned value. what you give and what you get.

FB people tried to defend themselves rather than asking I depth

 It is impossible to live without it, or even silly. I want to believe that it's not true. 

It is interesting just to delet your messenger from the phone for a week. 

 I expect more one to one physical contact.

It has been a joruney, but it is time to say goodbye. Let me do that by the song Creep Chorus featured in the movie Social Network.
