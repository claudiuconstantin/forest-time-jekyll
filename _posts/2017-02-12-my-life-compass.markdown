Some try to come up with a formula of life (Mark Manson, guy from Ted Talk with that table, Zsofi sent me), this is my solution.

I have came up with the term **"Life Compass"** to reference a set of questions covering 4 important directions of our lives: 

1. Goals for the future
2. Phisycal health
3. Relationships and contribution
4. Gratitude and satisfaction

<!--<div style="display: flex">

			max-height: 350px;
			margin-top: 1rem;
			margin-bottom: 2rem;
			margin: auto; 
			transform: none;
			"/>
</div>-->

The idea behind this compass is that our goal should always be to work on all the 4 directions *simultaneously* without exception. If one of the mentioned fields are dominating so hard that we don't have any resources left (time, energy, money) to maintain one of the other fields, than we have lost balance and chances are we are living an unhealthy lifestyle.

It might be helpful to come up with some combination of the directions and try to find which one matches our lifestyle the best.

### examples

Are we the ones who has such ambitious goals that we don't leave any resources for maintaining our Phisycal health? Or are we "maximists" who don't know the word "enough" and we are unable to show gratitude? Or are we the ones who play on the "experience" and not on the "erveny" so no real goal?



### importance of primary goal

meanwhile the importance of maintaining healthy relationships and Phisycal health is obvious, let me write down what personal goals mean for me.

A primary goal is a goal for the upcoming 2-6 months. It has to be one goal, and formulated in such way that it can be szamon kerni in practice. Achieving fulfillness, having balance" in our lives is not something accurate, so it has to be somehow more practical like "I woant to pass with 7+ grade". Another thing when I look at the digital watch and I see 17.17 I wish  can wish my personal goal -> repeat in myself to emphasize it.

For me currently it is to learn Danish.

### Gratitude and enoughism

No maximism -> be grateful, and optimize. Where you maximize something you minimize something else.

## How to apply

This all sound good, but how can we apply this mindset in our lives? It is all about 2 steps: design and execution. It has to be an iterative process and also a habit so we can review our performance.

Once in a week we have to have at least 30 minutes to stop, and think. Think about the past week and plan ahead. I found the best day to do that is Sundays.

The way I do it is that I do it on Sundays. It takes around 30 min, I sit down and look back and write down things. Google Docs. Also this process is connected with another activites: planning my calendar (which day to go out, when to leave blank time so whatever comes it comes - **fektavolsag**, I am planning to write on this later on as well.), and do my finances.

**The Navigator** is a quick, easy-to-follow guide which I have created for myself to evaluate my weeks and plan ahead with my duties and events. It is a simple Google Document, which you can copy week-by-week and can be filled out in minutes. The idea is, that I
