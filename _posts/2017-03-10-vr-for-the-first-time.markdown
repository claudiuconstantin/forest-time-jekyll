A couple of weeks ago, András and Bálint have invited Bánk, Dorka and me over, so we had the wonderful chance of trying out the HTC Vive VR headset.

A lot of footage has been made, so I decided to create a movie. It took way longer than I expected, but at least I could taste the flavour of movie editing, even if just a little bit. 

I also added English subtitles, so anyone can enjoy watching our clumsiness.

If you prefer you can also [watch the movie on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXOoJwANvMk).
