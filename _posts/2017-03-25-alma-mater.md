One of my very first projects using a frontend framework was AlmaMater, which was also a final project assignment for Copenhagen School of Design & Technology's Multimedia Design & Communication AP.

The application was build on [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) using the npm package manager. The purpose of the project was to create an e-textbook management software, where students can experience their curriculum in a more immerse way using various kinds of media, such as videos, interactive media elements and check tests.

The application's source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaboratorium/AlmaMater) and [a demo can be seen on GitHub Pages](http://gaboratorium.github.io/AlmaMater/#/).
