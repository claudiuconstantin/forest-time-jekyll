I have created my first Android game called [Flappy Hermelin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaboratorium.mytestgame), and published it on the Google Play store.

It was my first take on writing a native game, and what could be easier to experiment with than a Flappy Bird clone? As I already had classes in Android development at school, and my development environment was already set up for this platform, I was looking for something which integrates with it smoothly, and which is preferably open-source. This is how I've found this awesome framework called [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) which seemed and turned out to be very powerful. I strongly recommend it, however it might seem a [little difficult and overwhelming](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) without prior Java experience.

To learn from sketch, I have went through the tutorials of [Brent Aureli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzBVTPaUUDg&list=PLZm85UZQLd2TPXpUJfDEdWTSgszionbJy) and [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_hp6vMeewQ&t=2s), I recommend these whole-heartedly as well.

To save time on game design, I have bought my assets on [Gamedevmarket](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/), which seems like a really good source for indie game developers.

The game is of course open-source, and can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/gaboratorium/flappy-hermelin). It can be also downloaded directly from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaboratorium.mytestgame&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1).
