I have got a new job at [Shape](http://shape.dk) as a Backend Developer. Meanwhile I already had experience on Backend development with Node.js, PHP and C#, I wanted to dig deeper and obtain a great foundation. When I decided to become a Front end developer I followed this video. Step by step I learned the necessary techniques and tools.

When I started to think about how I should start my professional backend career, first I approached the queston wrong: I thought the most important question is to choose the right language. Which one should it be, there are so many? Should I go safe with Java (most job opportunities), follow the trends and fashion (Node.js) or be a real hip and learn something smart with Scala or Elixir (functional programming). Some many reasons for and against any. [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2017]().

I had different reasons for different languages. Node.js I already have experience with. 

So many metrics to evaluate.

Then I realized I have to approach this question the same as I did with Frontend: step by step, starting with the most important and most general things, and then continuing with more focused, more specific things. Meanwhile learning a new language is super-sexy and exciting, that is not the most important thing, and we should not engetni a kisertesnek.

To become a professional developer, the goal is not the be a ninja in one language or framework, but to understand and practice the principles and see the big picture. Sure enough, having a speciality is a huge plus, but that should be not the first step.

**I should start with universal things not with the divisive things**.

Therefore I created a new plan: I am going to focus on learn about the infrastructure as much as possible. Setting up servers manually, learning more about security, threads and protocolls. Here will be a list:

- this
- that
- and this as well

In order to bring this to practice I will use a DigitalOcean droplet (which by the way provides a 50$ voucher through GitHub Edu for students). Another thing is documenting the new learnings. I have learned from my Web Security teacher that as long as you don't document your activity, you just play. Which might be fine, but I want to be a professional. So Backend posts are coming.

The next step is algorithms and coding practices. Those, which have been relevant for ages, and also apply today. Those which are not language specific. This will be carried out by reading: Clean Coder, and more. Some theoritical stuff.

After all this I will be educated enough to choose a speciality in the field, because I will have a broader view on the differences and advantages of different languages and environments.
