[KEA Project 2](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject2) is a shared repository where among with some of my classmates we have shared our notes from the second semester at Copenhagen School of Design & Technology's Web Development BA. 

We had the following courses in this semester:

- Interface design
- Android development
- iOS development
- Project management
- Web security

Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.
