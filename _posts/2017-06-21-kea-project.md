## First semester

[KEA Project](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject) is a shared repository where my classmates and I have shared our notes from the first semester at Copenhagen School of Design & Technology's Web Development BA. 

We had three courses in this semester: 

- Web development
- Development environments
- Databases

Throughout the courses we have worked with the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C#, SQL. Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.

## Second semester

[KEA Project 2](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject2) is a repository created for the second semester's courses. We had the following courses in this semester:

- Interface design
- Android development
- iOS development
- Project management
- Web security

Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.

## Third semester

In the third semester of the programme we had to work on our Bachelor project. My project was called [Stash Backend]({{ site.baseurl }}/stash-backend) and you can find its source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaboratorium/stash).
