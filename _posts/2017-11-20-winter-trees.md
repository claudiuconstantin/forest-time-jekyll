title:  "Winter trees - Sylvia Plath"
description: "In this poem, Plath looks out and observes the trees in winter, envying their uncomplicated lives (especially their sex lives: ‘abortions’ and ‘bitchery’ are unknown to them, and they reproduce with ease) and yet finding no comfort or relief from her own troubled life by watching them"

The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.  
On their blotter of fog the trees  
Seem a botanical drawing.  
Memories growing, ring on ring,  
A series of weddings.  

Knowing neither abortions nor bitchery,  
Truer than women,  
They seed so effortlessly!  
Tasting the winds, that are footless,  
Waist-deep in history.  

Full of wings, otherworldliness.  
In this, they are Ledas.  
O mother of leaves and sweetness  
Who are these pietas?  
The shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing.
