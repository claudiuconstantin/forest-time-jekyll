My aspens dear, whose airy cages quelled,  
Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,  
All felled, felled, are all felled;  
Of a fresh and following folded rank  
Not spared, not one  
That dandled a sandalled  
Shadow that swam or sank  
On meadow and river and wind-wandering weed-winding bank.  

O if we but knew what we do  
When we delve or hew –  
Hack and rack the growing green!  
Since country is so tender  
To touch, her being so slender,  
That, like this sleek and seeing ball  
But a prick will make no eye at all,  

Where we, even where we mean  
To mend her we end her,  
When we hew or delve:  
After-comers cannot guess the beauty been.  
Ten or twelve, only ten or twelve  
Strokes of havoc unselve  
The sweet especial scene,  
Rural scene, a rural scene,  
Sweet especial rural scene.
