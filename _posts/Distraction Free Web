Addicted to notification and a safe place to go?


Block feeds on social media
The issue with site blockers that they are cheap we don't necessiarly want to block the features of them, meaning that from time to time I WANT to use YouTube, look at a Facebook Group, or check someone's Twitter profile.

The real time time waster is getting distracted by the wall, and checking messages too often.

- Restrict communication/messaging services to 2x a day: Facebook, Messenger, E-mail.
- Block: feed, (discover), comment section, related / suggestion / recommended, and-or show only search box (with suggested commands)

Distraction Free Web highly recommends to
-restrict checking your messegaes twice a day to cure addiction
-consume content consciulsy and avoid distracting suggestions

Inspiring quotes about time management and motivation such as
"Live by design not by default".
