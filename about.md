Hi, my name is Gabor Pinter, and I am a front end developer living in Copenhagen. I work at SimpleSite and study at KEA.

## The purpose
Blogging is a tool not a goal. There are 2 main purposes: 
  - to share what I know
  - to learn how to conciously formulate problems and solutions thoroughly


## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on Jekyll with my custom theme which I am planning to publish soon. Posts from WordPress have been migrated. The beautiful logo illustration is the work of [Jérémz Schneider](http://www.jeremyschneider.fr/).

## Get in touch
You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gaboratorium), [LinkedIn](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/gaboratorium)  and [GitHub](http://github.com/gaboratorium). If you are a Copenhagener as well, feel free to challenge me in squash!
