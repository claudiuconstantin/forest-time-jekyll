Hi, I am Gábor Pintér, front end developer [@SimpleSite](http://simplesite.com). I live in Copenhagen and study web development [@Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (KEA)](http://kea.dk).

## The purpose
I have started writing when I moved to Denmark in 2014, since then the blog went through several changes regarding content, context and platform. Today it mainly serves as a devlog and reference base. I have two goals with it:

- to share what I know, what I do, and why I do
- to learn how to consciously formulate problems and solutions thoroughly

Therefore during composing, simplicity and straight-to-the-point approach is preferred over 	
elegance. Raw facts, commands and steps in guidance may play.

## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with my custom theme. The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and posts from WordPress have been migrated. The beautiful logo illustration is the work of [Jérémy Schneider](http://www.jeremyschneider.fr/).

## Get in touch
You can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gaboratorium), [LinkedIn](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/gaboratorium)  and [GitHub](http://github.com/gaboratorium). If you are a Copenhagener as well, feel free to challenge me in squash!
