Welcome to [gaboratorium blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/), a traditional programming blog by me. My name is Gábor Pintér and I am a 26-year-old full-stack web developer located in Copenhagen, Denmark and I write about things I build.

The site is powered by Jekyll, a free static-site generator. It is hosted by GitHub Pages and the theme is a modified version of [The Plain theme](http://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) by [Heiswayi Nrird](http://heiswayi.github.io). The comment section is powered by [Disqus](https://disqus.com). The blog has been designed with special care of typography, colors and symmetry.
