{% include image.html file="forest.jpg" alt="Photo by Imat Bagja Gumilar from Unsplash" %}

## Under the hood

The entire blog is created and hosted by using only free resources, tools and services.

- The site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a free static-site generator
- It is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- The theme is a modified version of [The Plain theme](http://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) and [Gaboratorium](https://github.com/gaboratorium/gaboratorium.github.io)
- Photo illustrations are downloaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
