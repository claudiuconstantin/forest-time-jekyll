## Why blogging?

I have started writing when I moved to Denmark in 2014, since then the blog went through several changes regarding content, context and platform. Today I the main purpose of the blog for me is to learn how to formulate problems consciously and solutions thoroughly.

Therefore during composition, simplicity and straight-to-the-point approach may be preferred over 	
elegance.

## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
