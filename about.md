Hi, I am Gábor Pintér, front end developer [@SimpleSite](http://simplesite.com). I live in Copenhagen and study web development at [Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (KEA)](http://kea.dk).

## The purpose
I have started writing when I moved to Denmark in 2014, since then the blog went through several changes regarding content, context and platform. Today it mainly serves as and devlog and reference base. I have two goals with it:

- to share what I know, what I do, and why I do
- to learn how to consciously formulate problems and solutions thoroughly

Therefore quickness, simplicity and lightweightness is preferred over quiality writes. Raw information or duplicates may play.

## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on Jekyll with my custom theme which I am planning to publish soon. Posts from WordPress have been migrated. The beautiful logo illustration is the work of [Jérémz Schneider](http://www.jeremyschneider.fr/).
