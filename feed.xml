        <title>Winter trees - Sylvia Plath</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllwinter-trees</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;
On their blotter of fog the trees&lt;br /&gt;
Seem a botanical drawing.&lt;br /&gt;
Memories growing, ring on ring,&lt;br /&gt;
A series of weddings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing neither abortions nor bitchery,&lt;br /&gt;
Truer than women,&lt;br /&gt;
They seed so effortlessly!&lt;br /&gt;
Tasting the winds, that are footless,&lt;br /&gt;
Waist-deep in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full of wings, otherworldliness.&lt;br /&gt;
In this, they are Ledas.&lt;br /&gt;
O mother of leaves and sweetness&lt;br /&gt;
Who are these pietas?&lt;br /&gt;
The shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The trees - Philip Larkin</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllthe-trees</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The trees are coming into leaf&lt;br /&gt;
Like something almost being said;&lt;br /&gt;
The recent buds relax and spread,&lt;br /&gt;
Their greenness is a kind of grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it that they are born again&lt;br /&gt;
And we grow old? No, they die too,&lt;br /&gt;
Their yearly trick of looking new&lt;br /&gt;
Is written down in rings of grain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet still the unresting castles thresh&lt;br /&gt;
In fullgrown thickness every May.&lt;br /&gt;
Last year is dead, they seem to say,&lt;br /&gt;
Begin afresh, afresh, afresh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trees - Joyce Kilmer</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekylltrees</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that I shall never see&lt;br /&gt;
A poem lovely as a tree.&lt;br /&gt;
A tree whose hungry mouth is prest&lt;br /&gt;
Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;&lt;br /&gt;
A tree that looks at God all day,&lt;br /&gt;
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tree that may in Summer wear&lt;br /&gt;
A nest of robins in her hair;&lt;br /&gt;
Upon whose bosom snow has lain;&lt;br /&gt;
Who intimately lives with rain.&lt;br /&gt;
Poems are made by fools like me,&lt;br /&gt;
But only God can make a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Oread - Hilda Doolittle</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekylloread</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whirl up, sea — &lt;br /&gt;
whirl your pointed pines,&lt;br /&gt;
splash your great pines&lt;br /&gt;
on our rocks,&lt;br /&gt;
hurl your green over us,&lt;br /&gt;
cover us with your pools of fir.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aspens - Eduard Thomas</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllaspens</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All day and night, save winter, every weather,&lt;br /&gt;
Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,&lt;br /&gt;
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together&lt;br /&gt;
Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the blacksmith’s cavern comes the ringing&lt;br /&gt;
Of hammer, shoe, and anvil; out of the inn&lt;br /&gt;
The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing –&lt;br /&gt;
The sounds that for these fifty years have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,&lt;br /&gt;
And over lightless pane and footless road,&lt;br /&gt;
Empty as sky, with every other sound&lt;br /&gt;
Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails&lt;br /&gt;
In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,&lt;br /&gt;
In tempest or the night of nightingales,&lt;br /&gt;
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it would be the same were no house near.&lt;br /&gt;
Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,&lt;br /&gt;
Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear&lt;br /&gt;
But need not listen, more than to my rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves&lt;br /&gt;
We cannot other than an aspen be&lt;br /&gt;
That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,&lt;br /&gt;
Or so men think who like a different tree.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening - Robert Frost</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllstopping-by-woods</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whose woods these are I think I know. &lt;br /&gt;
His house is in the village though; &lt;br /&gt;
He will not see me stopping here &lt;br /&gt;
To watch his woods fill up with snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little horse must think it queer &lt;br /&gt;
To stop without a farmhouse near &lt;br /&gt;
Between the woods and frozen lake &lt;br /&gt;
The darkest evening of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He gives his harness bells a shake &lt;br /&gt;
To ask if there is some mistake. &lt;br /&gt;
The only other sound’s the sweep &lt;br /&gt;
Of easy wind and downy flake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woods are lovely, dark and deep, &lt;br /&gt;
But I have promises to keep, &lt;br /&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep, &lt;br /&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Way through the Woods - Rudyard Kipling</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllthe-way-through-the-woods</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;They shut the road through the woods&lt;br /&gt;
Seventy years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
Weather and rain have undone it again,&lt;br /&gt;
And now you would never know&lt;br /&gt;
There was once a road through the woods&lt;br /&gt;
Before they planted the trees.&lt;br /&gt;
It is underneath the coppice and heath,&lt;br /&gt;
And the thin anemones.&lt;br /&gt;
Only the keeper sees&lt;br /&gt;
That, where the ring-dove broods,&lt;br /&gt;
And the badgers roll at ease,&lt;br /&gt;
There was once a road through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, if you enter the woods&lt;br /&gt;
Of a summer evening late,&lt;br /&gt;
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools&lt;br /&gt;
Where the otter whistles his mate,&lt;br /&gt;
(They fear not men in the woods,&lt;br /&gt;
Because they see so few.)&lt;br /&gt;
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,&lt;br /&gt;
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,&lt;br /&gt;
Steadily cantering through&lt;br /&gt;
The misty solitudes,&lt;br /&gt;
As though they perfectly knew&lt;br /&gt;
The old lost road through the woods.&lt;br /&gt;
But there is no road through the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Loveliest of Trees, the Cherry Now - A. E. Housman</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllloveliest-of-trees</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Loveliest of trees, the cherry now&lt;br /&gt;
Is hung with bloom along the bough,&lt;br /&gt;
And stands about the woodland ride&lt;br /&gt;
Wearing white for Eastertide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, of my threescore years and ten,&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty will not come again,&lt;br /&gt;
And take from seventy springs a score,&lt;br /&gt;
It only leaves me fifty more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since to look at things in bloom&lt;br /&gt;
Fifty springs are little room,&lt;br /&gt;
About the woodlands I will go&lt;br /&gt;
To see the cherry hung with snow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Binsey Poplars - Gerard Manley Hopkins</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekyllbinsey-poplars</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My aspens dear, whose airy cages quelled,&lt;br /&gt;
Quelled or quenched in leaves the leaping sun,&lt;br /&gt;
All felled, felled, are all felled;&lt;br /&gt;
Of a fresh and following folded rank&lt;br /&gt;
Not spared, not one&lt;br /&gt;
That dandled a sandalled&lt;br /&gt;
Shadow that swam or sank&lt;br /&gt;
On meadow and river and wind-wandering weed-winding bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O if we but knew what we do&lt;br /&gt;
When we delve or hew –&lt;br /&gt;
Hack and rack the growing green!&lt;br /&gt;
Since country is so tender&lt;br /&gt;
To touch, her being so slender,&lt;br /&gt;
That, like this sleek and seeing ball&lt;br /&gt;
But a prick will make no eye at all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we, even where we mean&lt;br /&gt;
To mend her we end her,&lt;br /&gt;
When we hew or delve:&lt;br /&gt;
After-comers cannot guess the beauty been.&lt;br /&gt;
Ten or twelve, only ten or twelve&lt;br /&gt;
Strokes of havoc unselve&lt;br /&gt;
The sweet especial scene,&lt;br /&gt;
Rural scene, a rural scene,&lt;br /&gt;
Sweet especial rural scene.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Poison Tree - William Blake</title>       
        <link>http://localhost:4000//forest-time-jekylla-poison-tree</link>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was angry with my friend:&lt;br /&gt;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.&lt;br /&gt;
I was angry with my foe:&lt;br /&gt;
I told it not, my wrath did grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I watered it in fears.&lt;br /&gt;
Night and morning with my tears:&lt;br /&gt;
And I sunned it with smiles.&lt;br /&gt;
And with soft deceitful wiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it grew both day and night.&lt;br /&gt;
Till it bore an apple bright.&lt;br /&gt;
And my foe beheld it shine.&lt;br /&gt;
And he knew that it was mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And into my garden stole.&lt;br /&gt;
When the night had veild the pole;&lt;br /&gt;
In the morning glad I see;&lt;br /&gt;
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
