Tasting the winds, that are footless,&lt;br /&gt;
Waist-deep in history.&lt;/p&gt;

The shadows of ringdoves chanting, but chasing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jimmy Forester</name></author><summary type="html">The wet dawn inks are doing their blue dissolve.

Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,&lt;br /&gt;
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together&lt;br /&gt;
Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the blacksmith’s cavern comes the ringing&lt;br /&gt;
Of hammer, shoe, and anvil; out of the inn&lt;br /&gt;
The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing –&lt;br /&gt;
The sounds that for these fifty years have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,&lt;br /&gt;
And over lightless pane and footless road,&lt;br /&gt;
Empty as sky, with every other sound&lt;br /&gt;
Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silent smithy, a silent inn, nor fails&lt;br /&gt;
In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,&lt;br /&gt;
In tempest or the night of nightingales,&lt;br /&gt;
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it would be the same were no house near.&lt;br /&gt;
Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,&lt;br /&gt;
Aspens must shake their leaves and men may hear&lt;br /&gt;
But need not listen, more than to my rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves&lt;br /&gt;
We cannot other than an aspen be&lt;br /&gt;
That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,&lt;br /&gt;
Or so men think who like a different tree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jimmy Forester</name></author><summary type="html">All day and night, save winter, every weather, Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop, The aspens at the cross-roads talk together Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening - Robert Frost</title><link href="https://claudiuconstantin.github.io/forest-time-jekyll/stopping-by-woods" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening - Robert Frost" /><published>2018-11-15T10:23:16+02:00</published><updated>2018-11-15T10:23:16+02:00</updated><id>https://claudiuconstantin.github.io/forest-time-jekyll/stopping-by-woods</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://claudiuconstantin.github.io/forest-time-jekyll/stopping-by-woods">&lt;p&gt;Whose woods these are I think I know. &lt;br /&gt;

When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools&lt;br /&gt;
Where the otter whistles his mate,&lt;br /&gt;
(They fear not men in the woods,&lt;br /&gt;
Because they see so few.)&lt;br /&gt;
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,&lt;br /&gt;
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,&lt;br /&gt;
Steadily cantering through&lt;br /&gt;
The misty solitudes,&lt;br /&gt;
As though they perfectly knew&lt;br /&gt;
