## Why blogging?

I have started writing when I moved to Denmark in 2014, since then the blog went through several changes regarding content, context and platform. Today I have 2 goals with it:

  - to share what I know, what I do, and why I do with people who are eager to learn
  - to learn how to consciously formulate problems and solutions thoroughly

Therefore during composition, simplicity and straight-to-the-point approach may be preferred over 	
elegance.

## Under the hood
The blog currently is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and posts from WordPress have been migrated. The site is using a [beautiful theme designed by Heiswayi Nrird](https://github.com/heiswayi/the-plain) with minor custom modifications. The little guy on the top was designed by [Joanna Nielubiewatrobki](https://www.behance.net/user/?username=nielubiewatrobki).
