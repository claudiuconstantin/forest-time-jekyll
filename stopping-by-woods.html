	<div id="content"> <p>Whose woods these are I think I know. <br />
His house is in the village though; <br />
He will not see me stopping here <br />
To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

<p>My little horse must think it queer <br />
To stop without a farmhouse near <br />
Between the woods and frozen lake <br />
The darkest evening of the year.</p>

<p>He gives his harness bells a shake <br />
To ask if there is some mistake. <br />
The only other sound’s the sweep <br />
Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep, <br />
But I have promises to keep, <br />
And miles to go before I sleep, <br />
And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
