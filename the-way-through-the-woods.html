	<div id="content"> <p>They shut the road through the woods<br />
Seventy years ago.<br />
Weather and rain have undone it again,<br />
And now you would never know<br />
There was once a road through the woods<br />
Before they planted the trees.<br />
It is underneath the coppice and heath,<br />
And the thin anemones.<br />
Only the keeper sees<br />
That, where the ring-dove broods,<br />
And the badgers roll at ease,<br />
There was once a road through the woods.</p>

<p>Yet, if you enter the woods<br />
Of a summer evening late,<br />
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools<br />
Where the otter whistles his mate,<br />
(They fear not men in the woods,<br />
Because they see so few.)<br />
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,<br />
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,<br />
Steadily cantering through<br />
The misty solitudes,<br />
As though they perfectly knew<br />
The old lost road through the woods.<br />
But there is no road through the woods.</p>
